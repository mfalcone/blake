<h3>Entry Hall</h3>
<p class="big colorMD">
The entry hall is a brand new multipurpose space that will provide our community with the front door weâ€™ve been missing. This single entry will connect Middle and Lower School, create study and recreational spaces for use by the whole community and will significantly improve access to our most used campus.
